# A Few Quick Mods

This is mod manager for A Few Quick Matches using [UMP](https://github.com/nhaar/UMP).

To get started, add this folder "modmanager" into the Steam game directory.

## Adding mods

To add mods, you can add mods by adding a folder to the mod in the "mods" folder.

After you add all of the mods, run the file "run.bat" and it'll automatically replace the data.win file.

When you update the game, make sure to delete the "original_data.win" file in the folder "modmanager". Why? The original "data.win" is copied over to the "modmanager" folder when the modmanager is installed.

Check out UMP's documentation here: <https://github.com/nhaar/UMP/blob/main/guide/guide.md>

## Adding scripts

There is a "scripts/" folder where you can add in files that end with `.csx`.

If you put in a `.csx` file in the scripts folder, it'll run the script as if you would run the script in [UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool).

## Built-in mods and scripts

These are the mods and scripts that are built-in to the mod loader.
